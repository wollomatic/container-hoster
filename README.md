# container-hoster
A simple "etc/hosts" file injection tool to resolve names of local Docker containers on the host. It is inspired by [docker-hoster](https://github.com/dvddarias/docker-hoster) by [David Darias](https://github.com/dvddarias).


## Installation

The docker image is available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/wollomatic/container-hoster/). A sample docker-compose.yml file is provided in the repository. 

## Configuration
Container hoster is configured via environment variables. If no env variable is set, container-hoster will use the default value. The following variables are available:

* ``CH_HOSTSFILE``: The path to the hosts file to be injected. Defaults to ``/hosts``. The real hostfile should be mounted as a bind mount to this path.

* ``CH_INTERVAL``: The interval in seconds to check if an update for the hostsfile is needed. It is formatted as a Go duration string. A duration string is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "-1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h". Defaults to ``10s``.

* ``CH_HOSTNAME_FROM_CONTAINERNAME``: If set to true, the container name will be used as hostname. Defaults to ``true``.

* ``CH_HOSTNAME_FROM_LABEL``: If set to true, the value given in container label ``de.wollomatic.container-hoster.name`` will be used as hostname. Defaults to ``false``.

* ``CH_ONLY_LABELED_CONTAINERS``: If set to true, only containers with the label ``de.wollomatic.container-hoster.enable=true`` will be added to the hosts file and all other containers are ignored. Defaults to ``false``, so every container is added to the hosts file.

* ``CH_NETWORK_REGEXP``: A regular expression to match the network name of the container. Only containers with a matching network name will be added to the hosts file. Defaults to ``.*``.

* ``CH_LOG_EVENTS``: It set to true, all docker events which lead to rewrite the hosts file will be logged to stdout. Defaults to ``false``

## Container labels
Container labels are optional. The following labels are available:

* ``de.wollomatic.container-hoster.name``: The hostname to be used for the container if ``CH_HOSTNAME_FROM_LABEL`` is set to ``true``.

* ``de.wollomatic.container-hoster.enable``: If set to ``true``, the container will be added to the hosts file. Defaults to ``true``.

* ``de.wollomatic.container-hoster.exclude``: If set to ``true``, the container will be excluded from the hosts file.

## Security

In most cases the container-hoster container will be run a root. This is necessary to be able to write to the hosts file and connect to the docker socket. This is potentially dangerous, because a container which has full access to the docker socket could start and stop containers. Container-hoster will only listen to docker events and will not start or stop containers. It will only update the hosts file if a container is started or stopped.

The build container image is made from scratch and does not contain any additional software. The dependencies are scanned with [trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-action).

Container-hoster does not need to have access to any network.
